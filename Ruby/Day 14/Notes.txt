Ruby Set 
    - It stores elements just like array but only uniqe elements will be stored
    - No duplicate element will be stored
    - Set if fast to find if it includes any specific element or not 
    - In array to find any element it will iterate through all elements so it is time consuming
    - but in Set it doesn't have to iterate ,so it is very fast
        Ex : product = Set.new  # {}
             product << 1       # {1}
             product << 3       # {1,3}
             product << 1       # {1,3} didn't add 1 as it is already in Set
    - In array we have direct access to any elemet by index , but in set it is not possible
    - But set can be converted to array
    - Methods
        1. Union operator       : product | (1..4) => {1,2,3,4}
        2. Difference operator  : product - (3)    => {1,2,4}
        3. Intersection         : product & (2,4)  => {2,4}
    - Superset & Subset
        ‣ Superset is set that contains all the elements of other set.
            set.new(10..40) >= set.new(20..30)
        ‣ Subset is set that is made from parts of another set.
            set.new(30..40) <= set.new(10..50)
    - SortedSet : It will give set where all elements are sorted
            Ex  : srt = SortedSet.new
                  srt << 5
                  srt << 2
                  srt << 3
                  srt << 1
                  {1,2,3,5}
    
Hash 
    - In hash to cob=nvert any key to symbol use : hash.transform_keys!(&:to_sym)
