String Methods 
    - String is sequence of characters in "quatation" marks
      1.  str.size               : Returns size of String
      2.  str.empty?             : Returns true or false is string is empty or not
      3.  str.include?("st")     : Returns true if string includes "st"(or any string) else false
      4.  str.gsub(a,b)          : Will replace "a" from string with "b"
      5.  str.split              : gives array of given string , words separated by space
      6.  str.index("a")         : gives index of "a" , at which position "a" is first located in string 
      7.  str.casecmp st         : compares both string ignoring case and gives "0" if both are same else "1"
      8.  str.eql? st            : compare strings in case sensitive manner and gives true if both are same and in same case
      9.  str.upcase             : returns string in Upper Case
      10. str.downcase           : returns string in down case
      11. str.strip              : returns string after removing extra spaces before and after string
      12. str.start_with?(st)    : true if string starting with "st" else false
      13. str.end_with?(st)      : true if string ending with "st" else false
      14. str.match?(/\A-?\d+\Z/): returns true if string is made of only numbers else false
      15. str << "hello"         : Will insert "hello" at the end of string
      16. str.each_char{}        : wil Iterate through every character of string
      17. str.count(char)        : count how many times any specific character or string repeates in given string

OOP
    1. Cohesion
            - It is relation between all methods inside class
            - Low cohesion is like having unusual methods in class
            - High cohesion is like everything is where it has to be
    2. Coupling
            - It is how dependent is a class to other classes
    - Class methods : this methods are called using class only
                      and doesn't require any object

Regular Expression
    - It is also called regex
    - used to match pattern in given string
    - pattern match is achived by =~ and #match
        1. =~  -->  /check/ =~ string : here it checks is check matches with data of string
        2. #match --> /check/.match string : here it will check if check matches with any pattren in string
    - METACHARACTERS and ESCAPES
        - these have specific meaning in pattern
        - to match string, backslashes(\\) are used
        - ex: (,),(.),(?),(+),(-),(*),[,],{,}
        1. *    : Zero or more times 
        2. +    : one or more times
        3. ?    : zero or one times
        4. {n}  : Exactly n times
        5. {n,} : n or more times
        6. {,m} : m or less times
        7. {n,m}: Atleast n and at most m times
    - /regex/i will ignore case in Regulaer Expression
    - /regex/x will ignore extra spaces in Regulaer Expression
    - /regex/m will join the dot(.) work as same
    - /re.*ge.*x/m : here imaging every word is in different line with dor(.) but it will ignore lines
