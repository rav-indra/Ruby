      2.  str.empty?             : Returns true or false is string is empty or not
      3.  str.include?("st")     : Returns true if string includes "st"(or any string) else false

      5.  str.split              : gives array of given string , words separated by space
      6.  str.index("a")         : gives index of "a" , at which position "a" is first located in string 
      7.  str.casecmp st         : compares both string ignoring case and gives "0" if both are same else "1"
      8.  str.eql? st            : compare strings in case sensitive manner and gives true if both are same and in same case
      9.  str.upcase             : returns string in Upper Case
      10. str.downcase           : returns string in down case

OOP
    1. Cohesion
            - It is relation between all methods inside class
            - Low cohesion is like having unusual methods in class
            - High cohesion is like everything is where it has to be
            - 
    2. Coupling
            - It is how dependent is a class to other classes
