CSS
  - CSS can be applied three different ways
    1. Inline CSS   : here we can apply css rules in every element where we want to apply css 
    2. Internal CSS : here we write css rules between <style></style> tags in head 
    3. External CSS : here we link the external .css file to .html file using link tag in head
  - using plus (+) in css element it will apply the css properties to only next element
    Ex: h1 + p {} , here this properties will be applied to only that p tag which next to h1 tag and rest p tags will be unchaged 
  - CSS selectors
    - to select any html tag just use that tag name, like body{}, p{}
    - to select any class from html tag , use class name with dot(.) followed by class name, like .name {}
    - to select any id from html use hash(#) followed by id name ,like #name{}
    - to select everything use (*)
    - to select any property of perticular tag, class or id use name:property or .name:property or #name:property 
    - in css selectors if two selectors are changing same properties , the selector with higher priority will be applied, like between
      p{color:red;} and .abc{color:green;} properties in .abc tag will be applied
    - but if same selectors are changing same properties differently than the last one will be allpied
      Ex: p{color:red;} p{color:green;} , here text color will be green as it excecutes last , so it will override earlier 
    - An element selector is less specific; it will select all elements of that type that appear on a page, so it has less weight.
    - A class selector is more specific; it will select only the elements on a page that have a specific class attribute value, so it has more weight.

CSS Inheritance Control
  1. Inherit      : Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element
  2. Initial      : Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of that property.
  3. Revert       : Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the browser's default styling rather than the defaults applied to that property.
  4. Revert-layer : Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value established in a previous
  5. Unset        : Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.
