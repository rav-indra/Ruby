JavaScript

Ways to add JavaScript in HTML
  - inline JS
  - onpage JS
  - CDN

JavaScript vs JQuery
  1. JavaScript is independent language and it exists its own
     meanwhile JQuery is dependent on JS , and it was made for JavaScript, 
     JQuery code has to be converted in JS to execute in browser
  2. JavaScript uses more line of code for any task,
     while JQuery is a library of predefined code and just need to be imported , so it will use less line of code
  3. JS is written between <script></script> tags,
     JQuery is imported from CDN or any lacation from PC where it is downloaded ,
     it is also written between <script></script>
  4. JS take too much space and JQuery take less space
  5. JS is comparatively faster than JQuery as JS can be executed directly in browsers
     But JQuery need to be converted to JS to execute in browser
