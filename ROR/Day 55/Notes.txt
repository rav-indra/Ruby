Authentication in Form
  # Password Encryption Technique
  "Never store passwords in the database as plain text"
    - Hash Password     : - Hashing is the process of applying mathematical functions and algorithms to a string of data to produce a unique output string. 
                          - While creating a new user, the plain text password gets hashed then saved into the database.
                            When the user signs in, the input password gets hashed and compared with the hashed password stored in the database.
                          - This technique is called one-way encryption, meaning, the same inputs with the same hashing function will always give the same output.
                          - Can implement Hashed method using SHA1
                            require 'digest/sha1'
                            encrypted_password= Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(password)
    - Salting Password  : - ‘Salt’ is an additional string of data added to the password before encrypting it.
                            It should be unique and random, to render the Rainbow tables flaw useless.

Devise Gem
  # It's composed of 10 modules:
    - Database Authenticatable  : hashes and stores a password in the database to validate the authenticity of a user while signing in. The authentication can be done both through POST requests or HTTP Basic Authentication.
    - Omniauthable              : adds OmniAuth (https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) support.
    - Confirmable               : sends emails with confirmation instructions and verifies whether an account is already confirmed during sign in.
    - Recoverable               : resets the user password and sends reset instructions.
    - Registerable              : handles signing up users through a registration process, also allowing them to edit and destroy their account.
    - Rememberable              : manages generating and clearing a token for remembering the user from a saved cookie.
    - Trackable                 : tracks sign in count, timestamps and IP address.
    - Timeoutable               : expires sessions that have not been active in a specified period of time.
    - Validatable               : provides validations of email and password. It's optional and can be customized, so you're able to define your own validations.
    - Lockable                  : locks an account after a specified number of failed sign-in attempts. Can unlock via email or after a specified time period.
