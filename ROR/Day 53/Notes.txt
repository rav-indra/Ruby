Friendly Id
  - Friendly id is used to hide the id or parameters from url
  - Usually when we click and show any record it will have id of that record , that way it 
    looks non user-friendly and one can easily guess how many record we have and can see other records too
  - That's when friendly id comes in use 
  - it will show slug name instead of id in url
  - It lets you create pretty URLs and work with human-friendly strings as if they were numeric ids.
    Ex : From -> https://example.com/states/4323454
         To   -> https://example.com/states/USA
