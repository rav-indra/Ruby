Rails Environment
  # Development
    - In development mode Rails reloads all app classes and turns off caching to allow a faster development cycle.
      This is how the app runs on a development workstation.
  # Production
    - In production mode all caching is turned on, often pointing to a memcached server.
      This is how the app runs on the live server.
  # Test
    - The test mode is used in the tests, we have a special throw away database used only for test,
      wiped out between test runs.
