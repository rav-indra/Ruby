Mailers
  - Action Mailer allows you to send emails from your application using mailer classes and views
  - Example where action mailers are used:
    -> Sending a welcome email after registration
    -> Sending a confirmation emails before allowing users to access their system
    -> Weekly updates when you subcribe an application's newsletter
  - Need to install bundle : bundle install
  - Need gem "letter_opener"
  - Add these line of code in : ./config/environments/development.rb
    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
    config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
