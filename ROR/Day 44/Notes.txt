Views
  - Combination of three rails elements : Templates, Partials, Layouts
    1) Templates
      -> If the template file has a .erb extension then it uses a mixture of ERB (Embedded Ruby) and HTML.
         If the template file has a .builder extension then the Builder::XmlMarkup library is used.
      -> ERB : If doesn't return anything => <%...your code...%>
               If it returnd soemthing => <%=...your code...%>
      -> Builder : Builder templates are a more programmatic alternative to ERB. They are especially useful for generating XML content.
                   An XmlMarkup object named xml is automatically made available to templates with a .builder extension
    2) Partials
      -> They are another device for breaking the rendering process into more manageable chunks.
         With partials, you can extract pieces of code from your templates to separate files and also reuse them throughout your templates.
      -> Naming partials : To render a partial as part of a view, use the render method within the view e.g. :- <%= render "menu" %>
                           partials are named with a leading underscore to distinguish them from regular views e.g. :- _menu.html.erb
      -> Using Partials to simplify Views : to treat them as the equivalent of subroutines; 
                                            a way to move details out of a view so that you can grasp what's going on more easily
      -> Rendering Collections : <%= render partial: "product", collection: @products %>

View Paths
  - We can add other locations and give them certain precedence when resolving paths using the prepend_view_path and append_view_path methods
    1) Prepend view path
    ->  when we want to put views inside a different directory for subdomains.
        prepend_view_path "app/views/#{request.subdomain}"
    2) Append Viwe Path
    -> append_view_path "app/views/direct" 
       This will add app/views/direct to the end of the lookup paths.

Helpers
  - Rails provides many helper methods to use with Action View. These include methods for:
    -> Formatting dates, strings and numbers
    -> Creating HTML links to images, videos, stylesheets, etc...
    -> Sanitizing content
    -> Creating forms
    -> Localizing content
