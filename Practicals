DONE 1: Create one hash program dynamic added value into the hash. If user add 5, then 5 items are save into the hash.

DONE 2: Created one hash program with can changes the existing value. Like if user give index 2 and value 50, then i’ll  changes the value of 2 index. Or if given index are not found than value are added into last of the hash items.

DONE 3: Created one hash program hash = {a: 1, 'b' => 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: "i am e"}, get value as per given key, FOR ex:   user enter a as a key then it return 1. 


4:  Created two hash 
	first = {a: 10, bb: 20, 'c': 30, dfg: "first_hash_item"}
	second = {'a': 10, bb: 20, c: 30, dfg: "second_hash_item"}

	Creating  third hash as per above two hash.
	third = {bb:40, dfg: "first_hash_item WITH second_hash_item"}

DONE 5:  Created one simple demo for transportation using the Modules.
	It created classes for cars, trains , bikes, airplanes, and yachts.
	That created a simple method for a trip.
	EXAMPLE: If i call car class method trip then it give me output like
			- "THIS VEHICLE IS FOR REAL ONLY".

DONE 6: We have one string class, in that I want four function.
	- reverse, first_latter_capital, array_as_per_word, count_special_letter.

7: I have one company, and i have 15+ employee, So i want to count below things
	- How many male or how many female
	- How many employee are more the age 30 +
	- How many employee's salary are in between the 25000 to 32000
	- How many employees have a 2 to 5 year of experience.

8 :Created one program for array. [5,8,6,3,2,4,5,12,52,65,21,20]
Find the descending order sorting. And also find the odd and even number. 

DONE 9: Create one array example for swap. In that, swapper these two index keys which are given by the user. Ex: arr = [1,3,5]  swap_key: 2, 0 so index 2 and index 0 value are swapped.
